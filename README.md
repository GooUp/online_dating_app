## Overview

ImSeekingGeeks was the result of my graduate Software Engineering Project Management class. I developed the concept and the appplication from start to finish. The application uses Nuxt.js on the front-end and Express.js on the back-end with a MongoDB database.



## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
